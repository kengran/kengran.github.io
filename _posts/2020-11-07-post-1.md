[Here](http://kengran.github.io/files/atomic-coord-files-Yang-and-White-CCR-2020.zip) you can find the atomic coordination files in `.car` format (native in DMol3 software) from my [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884620315465?via%3Dihub) on modeling of the early stage formation mechanisms of cementitious materials. They include:

- Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ca(OH)<sup>+</sup>, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
- SiO<sub>x</sub>(OH)<sub>4-x</sub><sup>x-</sup>, SiO<sub>x</sub>(OH)<sub>4-x</sub>\*xNa
- Al(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, Al(OH)<sub>4</sub>\*Na

They could serve as a good starting point if you want to do atomic simulation on the same/similar species. Please contact me if you have any questions when using these files!
